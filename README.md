# Shared Secret
### A Mobile app frontend for [Age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age)/[Minisign](https://github.com/jedisct1/minisign) key exchange


This project aims to create a mobile application to support the use of age and minisign for mobile devices and make key exchange easy for everyday usage.


**Key Features:**

- provide a frontend to use age and minisign on mobile plattforms (Android/IOS)
- exchange public (age/minisign) keys by displaying a QR code on mobile devices
- optionally exchange an additional shared secret (password) via QR code to provide post-quantum resistance
- manage stored public keys (Save public key data with a contacts name, email or phone number?)

**To be determined**

- Which frameworks to use for mobile app development
- Using age or rage as backend?
- Optional key exchange via NFC?


## Motivation

Age and minisign were designed to provide a modern alternative to pgp with shorter, easier to handle public keys. However, key exchange is still one of the most significant challenges for secure file encryption and signing. Providing a mobile app to exchange public keys via QR code intents to make the use of these applications easier and more accessible. 


## Current Status

- initial application design
